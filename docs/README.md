# Learning can be fun!

At this repo you can view (and play!) three
educational games. The goal of these games is to help children learn English (mostly, but not only, vocabulary).
Developed in Vanila JS, these games can be downloaded and have there context replaced, based on the teacher's 
current teaching subjects.
